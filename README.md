1. Invisible Cloak - Imagine being able to disappear just like in Harry Potter! This project uses OpenCV to detect the color of your cloak (red) and replace it with the background in real-time. As you move, the cloak creates the illusion of invisibility, hiding you from view. It combines color detection and background subtraction techniques to make it feel like magic â€“ turning the fictional invisibility cloak into a reality using computer vision!
